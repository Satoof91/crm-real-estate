 building the app\web and focus on the requirements :



Requirements Documentation (The BA Hat)

I'll expand on your four points to include implied requirements and user stories.

1. Contact/Customer Management

This module manages all people, primarily tenants.



Entities: Contact, Tenant (a type of Contact)

Key Fields:

Full Name

Phone Number (Must be WhatsApp-enabled, with a validation flag)

Email

National ID / Passport Number

Primary Language (for notification templates)

Status (e.g., Prospect, Active Tenant, Past Tenant)

User Story: "As a building owner, I need to store and quickly find a tenant's contact details, especially their WhatsApp number, so I can link them to a contract."

2. Property & Unit Management (Assets)

This module manages your physical inventory.



Entities: Building, Unit (e.g., Apartment)

Hierarchy: A Building can have many Units.

Key Building Fields:

Building Name (e.g., "Plaza Tower")

Address

Total Number of Units

Key Unit Fields:

Unit Number (e.g., "Apt 101")

Type (e.g., 2-Bedroom, Studio, Retail)

Size (e.g., 80 sqm)

Status (Critical: Vacant, Occupied, Under Maintenance)

User Story: "As a building owner, I want to see a list of all my apartments and their status (vacant/occupied) at a glance so I know what's available to rent."

3. Contract & Lease Management (The "Glue")

This is the core module that connects Contacts to Units.



Entity: Contract / Lease

Relationships:

Links one or more Contacts (Tenants) to one Unit.

Triggers a change in Unit.Status from Vacant to Occupied.

Key Fields:

Start Date

End Date

Rent Amount

Payment Frequency (e.g., Monthly, Quarterly)

Security Deposit Amount

Contract Document (File Upload)

User Story: "As a building owner, I want to create a new contract for a tenant, linking them to 'Apt 101' from January 1st to December 31st for $1000/month."

4. Payment & Invoice Tracking (New Module)

You mentioned "upcoming payment" and "received payment." This implies a simple finance ledger.



Entity: Invoice / Payment

Key Feature: When a Contract is created, the system should auto-generate the payment schedule (e.g., 12 invoice records, one for the 1st of each month).

Key Fields:

Due Date

Amount Due

Status (Pending, Paid, Overdue)

Date Paid

User Story: "As a building owner, when I mark the June invoice as Paid, I want the system to log the payment and send me a 'Payment Received' notification."

5. Notification Engine (WhatsApp Integration)

This is the "why" of the project. It monitors the other modules for key events.



Key Technical Constraint: This requires the WhatsApp Business API. You cannot do this reliably with a personal WhatsApp account. This means using a third-party API provider like Twilio, MessageBird, or Meta's own API, which will have a (small) per-message or per-conversation cost.

Notification Triggers (Events):

Event: Payment.DueDate is 7 days away AND Payment.Status is Pending.

Action: Send WhatsApp to Owner: "Reminder: Rent for Unit 101 (Tenant: John) is due in 7 days."

Event: Payment.Status changes to Paid.

Action: Send WhatsApp to Owner: "Confirmation: Payment of $1000 received for Unit 101."

Event: Contract.EndDate is 30 days away.

Action: Send WhatsApp to Owner: "Alert: Contract for Unit 101 (Tenant: John) expires in 30 days."

Event: Contract.StartDate is 1 day away.

Action: Send WhatsApp to Owner: "Info: Tenant John's contract for Unit 101 starts tomorrow.
